# PARCE Roadmap

Living plan. **Each session reads this to find its task and updates it before
finishing.** See [AGENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md](AGENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md) for the
protocol and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design.

## ▶ Next up

**PR 6 — Cross-source KG merge.** Merge per-study subgraphs from *different*
sources (CELLxGENE + GEO) into one knowledge graph, deduped by ontology entity ID,
with provenance preserved on edges. The shared-entity machinery already exists:
both normalizers register `BiologicalEntityNode`s keyed by `ontology_id` and emit
edges whose **targets** are those IDs (the originating node differs by source — see
ARCHITECTURE §4 — but the merge keys on targets). Build the merger in `graph/`
(reserved for exactly this since PR 3), take a list of `KnowledgeGraphOutput`
subgraphs → one merged graph, dedup entities by `ontology_id`, keep all
study/dataset/sample nodes, and carry source provenance so a shared entity records
which studies touch it. **Assert a cross-source edge exists in tests** — e.g. a
CELLxGENE study and a GEO study that both touch `UBERON:0002048` (lung) or a shared
`MONDO:` disease become connected through that one entity node. Offline unit tests
only (assemble two canned subgraphs and merge); no network.

## PR sequence

Each PR is one branch, one focused scope, green CI, and a roadmap update.

- [x] **PR 1 — Foundations & tooling.** CLAUDE.md, docs (architecture, roadmap,
  session prompt), GitHub Actions CI (ruff, mypy, pytest), ruff rule set + mypy
  config in `pyproject.toml`, code formatted to baseline. No behavior change.
- [x] **PR 2 — Canonical KG schema.** Source-agnostic nodes/edges; add
  `SampleNode` with design covariates; drop `experimental_narrative` and
  `CellType`. Migrate builder + tests.
- [x] **PR 3 — Source-adapter interface + cheap CELLxGENE adapter.** Defined
  `SourceAdapter` / `Normalizer` protocols in `sources/` + `normalize/`. Refactored
  CELLxGENE into a deterministic adapter + normalizer. **Removed the LLM/Azure
  narrative path entirely** (deleted `agent/curator.py`, `agent/prompts.py`,
  `models/narrative.py`, the `NarrativeOutput` schema, and the step-2 block in
  `main.py`). Dropped cell-type extraction. Removed the `parce.tools.*` mypy
  exemption as those modules moved under `sources/`.
- [x] **PR 4 — Ontology resolver (stage + organism wiring).** Shared `ontology/`
  stage (see ARCHITECTURE §5): pinned the **facet → ontology registry** constant
  (EFO/OBI/PSI-MS, UBERON, MONDO, NCBITaxon, ChEBI, EDAM); `OlsClient` (OLS4 REST,
  retry-wrapped, injectable); on-disk `ResolutionCache` (negative results cached);
  `OntologyResolver` (cache → OLS exact-then-fuzzy → pluggable LLM-fallback hook,
  default off); and the **`molecular_layer` derivation** (EFO `is-a` ancestor walk
  → pinned anchor labels; no-anchor default `UNKNOWN`). Replaced the hardcoded
  `_ORGANISM_ONTOLOGY` map in `normalize/cellxgene.py` with runtime NCBITaxon
  resolution. **Decided: OLS4-only** for now (text2term/Zooma deferred to GEO/PR 5
  — CELLxGENE ships IDs, only organism free-text needed grounding). IDs resolved
  at runtime; none hardcoded. *Split from the original PR 4: the schema change
  (store the EFO assay term + `molecular_layer`) became PR 4b.*
- [x] **PR 4b — Schema refinement.** Replaced free-text `modality` with an EFO
  `assay` term ID + a stored `molecular_layer` enum on `StudyNode`/`DatasetNode`;
  wired assay grounding (taken from Census's already-grounded payload) + layer
  derivation into `CellxgeneNormalizer` via a new `OntologyService` contract;
  migrated the schema and all tests. **Switched `molecular_layer` matching from
  exact EFO labels to ordered substring keywords** after validating against live
  EFO (the 10x family never reaches `RNA assay`); ambiguous lineages (bare
  mass-spec, multi-omic terms) stay `UNKNOWN` by design.
- [x] **PR 5 — GEO extraction agent (vertical slice).** Deterministic `GeoAdapter`
  (`sources/geo.py`): fetches GEO Series+Sample SOFT text from the GEO accession
  endpoint, parses it (no GEOparse dep), carries `characteristics_ch1` **verbatim**
  in the `RawRecord`. Agent-backed `GeoNormalizer` (`normalize/geo.py`): an LLM
  (boxed behind the narrow sync `StructuredExtractor` seam, `agent/base.py`) fills
  the `GeoExtraction` schema via `response_format` — design covariates only, no
  field for any data-inferred annotation. `SampleNode`s now populated (organism +
  data_uri read deterministically from structured SOFT fields; condition/
  perturbation/timepoint/subject from the LLM). Facets grounded through the existing
  `OntologyResolver`; the agent is **wired as the resolver's LLM fallback**
  (`make_ontology_fallback`, opt-in). The concrete Azure agent
  (`agent/extraction.py`) bridges the async `agent-framework` API to the sync seam.
  **`parce.agent.*` mypy exemption removed** — the whole of `src/parce` is now
  type-checked. **Blocker:** live Azure extraction round-trip unverified (no
  `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` in the headless env); deterministic GEO fetch/parse
  verified live. *(GEO keyword `discover` via Entrez deferred to backlog — adapter
  `discover` is identity on a `GSEnnnnn`, mirroring CELLxGENE's DOI identity.)*
- [ ] **PR 6 — Cross-source KG merge.** Merge CELLxGENE + GEO into one graph
  linked through shared ontology entities; dedup; provenance on edges. Assert a
  cross-source edge exists in tests. *(Next up — see top of file.)*
- [ ] **PR 7 — PRIDE proteomics adapter.** Second modality; prove the interface
  is modality-general. Adapter + extraction normalizer + integration test.
- [ ] **PR 8 — KG export for modeling.** Serialize per-study context + sample
  manifest + data URIs in the form the downstream OQAE/model consumes.

## Backlog / ideas

- ENCODE adapter (clean structured epigenomics) if a deterministic second
  modality is wanted.
- Imaging modality (IDR / Human Protein Atlas) — needs a different OQAE encoder.
- Graph database backend (Neo4j) vs. flat JSON export — revisit at PR 8.
- Discovery agent: given a research theme, propose seed DOIs/accessions across
  repositories.
- GEO keyword `discover` via Entrez `esearch`+`esummary` (the adapter's `discover`
  is currently the identity on a `GSEnnnnn` accession). Pairs with the discovery
  agent above.

## Session Log

Newest first. One entry per working session: what changed, decisions made, and
what the next session should know. Keep entries short and factual.

### 2026-06-29 — PR 5 integration boundary verified (Azure extraction live)

- No code change. Scheduled session; the roadmap's ▶ Next up resolves to PR 6, but
  PR 5 was still an **open draft (PR #9)** with one documented blocker: the live
  Azure extraction round-trip was unverified. Cleared that blocker rather than
  starting PR 6 on top of an unverified GEO path.
- **Stale-base catch again:** the routine worktree's local `main` was `64ed4f4`
  (PR 6-era), two merges behind `origin/main` (`4dcd5b7`); its roadmap showed PR 4.
  `git fetch` + compare caught it and revealed PR #9 already open for PR 5 — so PR 5
  was **not** rebuilt. Operated on the existing `pr5-geo-extraction-agent` branch.
- **Why the prior session couldn't verify, and why this one could:** `Settings`
  loads `.env` from the *worktree* root (`parents[3]`), which has none. The real
  `.env` (with `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` + deployment) sits at the **repo** root;
  sourcing it into the environment makes the live test's `skipif` pass and `Settings`
  pick the creds up. `az login` was already active.
- **Result:** `uv run pytest -m integration tests/test_geo_integration.py` → **2
  passed** (live GEO fetch + **live Azure extraction** against the `gpt-4o`
  deployment, ~48s). The full GEO vertical slice is now verified end-to-end. All
  four gates re-confirmed green on this branch (hermetic, no `.env`): ruff check,
  ruff format --check (47), mypy (28 files), **168 unit tests** (13 deselected).
- **Follow-up (non-blocking):** `agent_framework` emits a `DeprecationWarning` — the
  extractor passes `temperature` via `run(options=...)` runtime kwargs; the new API
  wants `client_kwargs`/`function_invocation_kwargs`. Works today; tidy when PRIDE
  (PR 7) touches `agent/extraction.py`.
- **Next session:** PR 5 (#9) is verified and ready for human review/merge — left as
  draft, not merged, per protocol. Once it merges, ▶ Next up is **PR 6** (cross-source
  KG merge), which can now rely on the GEO path being live.

### 2026-06-28 — PR 5: GEO extraction agent (vertical slice)

- Branch `pr5-geo-extraction-agent` off **`origin/main`** (4dcd5b7).
- **Stale-base catch (heeded the memory hazard):** the routine worktree's local
  `main` was `64ed4f4`, two merges behind `origin/main` (PR 4 #7 + PR 4b #8). The
  worktree's roadmap therefore showed PR 4 as "▶ Next up" — already merged.
  `git fetch` + compare to `origin/main` caught it; rebased onto origin and did the
  *real* next item (PR 5). Did **not** rebuild PR 4.
- **New files.** `sources/geo.py` (`GeoAdapter` + SOFT parser), `normalize/geo.py`
  (`GeoNormalizer` + `GeoExtraction`/`SampleExtraction` schemas), `agent/base.py`
  (`StructuredExtractor` Protocol), `agent/extraction.py` (`AzureExtractionAgent` +
  `make_ontology_fallback`). Tests: `test_geo_adapter.py`, `test_geo_normalize.py`,
  `test_geo_integration.py` (marked).
- **Design decisions (rationale):**
  - **Deterministic vs LLM split.** GEO ships some fields structured (per-sample
    `organism`, `supplementary_file`) — those are read straight from the record; the
    LLM only parses the genuinely free-text `characteristics_ch1` into design
    covariates and reads study-level assay/tissue/disease from the prose. Follows
    "could a deterministic step do this? then do it" (CLAUDE.md).
  - **Sample set is the record's, not the LLM's.** One `SampleNode` per real `GSM`;
    the extraction is matched in by `sample_id`, so a dropped/hallucinated sample
    can't change graph shape. Extraction failure degrades to samples-without-
    covariates (logged), never a crash.
  - **No `DatasetNode` for GEO.** A series *is* the study (data is per-sample suppl
    files), so `assay`/`molecular_layer` live on `StudyNode` and design-context +
    `HAS_SAMPLE` edges originate at the study. Merge (PR 6) keys on entity
    `ontology_id` **targets**, so the differing origin vs CELLxGENE is fine.
    Recorded in ARCHITECTURE §4.
  - **No GEOparse dependency.** The fields needed are a handful of `!`-keys in SOFT
    text; a ~40-line parser keeps deps minimal and the parse unit-testable. No dep
    changes, so `uv.lock` untouched.
  - **`discover` = identity on a `GSEnnnnn`** (mirrors CELLxGENE's DOI identity);
    Entrez keyword search → backlog.
  - **LLM boxed behind a sync `StructuredExtractor` seam** (`agent/base.py`); the
    async `agent-framework` bridge lives only in `agent/extraction.py`. Normalizers
    stay sync + offline-testable with a fake extractor. The agent is also wired as
    the resolver's LLM fallback (`make_ontology_fallback`, accepts a result only if
    the CURIE prefix matches the facet's ontology). ARCHITECTURE §3 updated.
  - Added optional `ncbi_email`/`ncbi_api_key` settings (+ `.env.example`); passed
    to the adapter, never read by it directly (keeps unit tests Settings-free).
- **mypy:** removed the `parce.agent.*` override — **all of `src/parce` now
  type-checked** (28 files; agent-framework/azure are untyped so the glue is `Any`
  at the boundary, which is sound here).
- **Gates green (hermetic — no `.env` in the worktree):** ruff check, ruff format
  --check (47 files), mypy (28 files), **168 unit tests** (13 integration
  deselected). Live `TestLiveGeoFetch` run against the real GEO endpoint — passes
  (SOFT parser validated on `GSE10072`).
- **BLOCKER (integration boundary, per protocol) — RESOLVED 2026-06-29 (see entry
  above):** the live **Azure extraction**
  round-trip is **unverified** — this headless env has `az login` but no
  `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` configured (no worktree `.env`), so
  `TestLiveGeoExtraction` skips. The Azure call shape mirrors the previously-working
  `agent/curator.py` (`agent.run(prompt, response_format=Model)` → `result.value`).
  **Next session with Azure creds:** run `uv run pytest -m integration
  tests/test_geo_integration.py` to confirm the live extraction, before relying on
  the GEO path in PR 6's cross-source merge.
- **Next session:** PR 6 (cross-source KG merge) — see top of file.

### 2026-06-26 — PR 4b: Schema refinement (EFO assay term + stored molecular_layer)

- Branch `pr4b-schema-refinement` off `main` (35a28ce, the PR 4 merge). Note: the
  scheduled session started on a stale worktree whose `main` predated the PR 4
  merge; `gh` showed PR #7 already MERGED, so PR 4 was done and **PR 4b was the
  real ▶ Next up**. Re-based onto `origin/main` before starting.
- **Schema (`models/graph_schema.py`).** Dropped `StudyNode.modality`. Both
  `StudyNode` and `DatasetNode` now carry `assay` (EFO term ID, required) +
  `molecular_layer` (`MolecularLayer`, default `UNKNOWN`). `DatasetNode.assay`
  changed meaning from free-text name → grounded EFO ID.
- **Normalizer (`normalize/cellxgene.py`).** Per dataset: pick the grounded EFO
  assay ID from Census's payload (`ontology_summary.assays`, matched to the
  dominant `modality` *name*) and derive `molecular_layer` from it; `StudyNode`
  built at the end with the **most-frequent** dataset assay as its representative
  + that assay's layer. Layer derivation memoised per assay ID; only `EFO:` IDs
  are walked (an ungrounded `unknown` assay → `UNKNOWN`, no network call).
- **Decision — assay taken from payload, not re-resolved.** CELLxGENE ships the
  EFO assay ID; Census is authoritative for its own data and re-resolving via OLS
  could drift, so the resolver is used *only* for the lineage walk. Free-text
  sources (GEO/PRIDE) will resolve the assay string first. (ARCHITECTURE §5.)
- **Decision — `molecular_layer` matching: exact labels → substring keywords.**
  Probing live EFO exposed the PR 4 gotcha for real: `EFO:0009922` (10x 3' v3, the
  bulk of CELLxGENE) never reaches `RNA assay` — it sits under `…transcription
  profiling`/`library preparation`; ATAC/ChIP/methylation/WGS all collapse to a
  generic `DNA assay` ancestor. Rewrote `ontology/layers.py` to ordered,
  case-insensitive **substring keywords** (transcriptome/epigenome/proteome/
  metabolome before the broad GENOME `DNA` signals), validated against live EFO.
  Bare mass-spec and multi-omic terms stay `UNKNOWN` by design (genuinely
  ambiguous). The marked integration test now asserts exact layers (10x + scRNA →
  TRANSCRIPTOME, ATAC → EPIGENOME) and **passed live** this session.
- **New contract `OntologyService`** (`ontology/base.py`, exported) = `TermResolver`
  + `molecular_layer`; the normalizer depends on it so offline fakes inject both
  methods. `base.py` now imports `MolecularLayer` (models is a leaf; no cycle).
- **Gates green incl. hermetic no-`.env` run:** ruff check, ruff format --check
  (40 files), mypy (24 files), **133 unit tests**. Live OLS integration suite (6)
  also passed. No dep changes; no new mypy exemptions.
- **Next session:** PR 5 (GEO extraction agent) — first LLM/Azure source; needs
  credentials. Wire the GEO free-text facets through the existing resolver and
  supply the agent as its LLM-fallback callback. If Azure creds are missing, stop
  at the integration boundary and log the blocker.

### 2026-06-25 — PR 4: Ontology resolver (stage + organism wiring)

- Branch `pr4-ontology-resolver` off `main` (64ed4f4).
- **Split decision.** The roadmap's PR 4 bundled the resolver stage *and* the
  schema change (free-text `modality` → EFO `assay` term + stored
  `molecular_layer`). Shipped the stage + organism wiring here; the schema
  migration is now **PR 4b** (new ▶ Next up). Rationale: the stage is a coherent,
  fully-tested unit; the schema swap touches the canonical models + every
  CELLxGENE test and is cleaner as its own focused PR.
- **New package `src/parce/ontology/`** (stable core, fully mypy-checked):
  - `registry.py` — `Facet` enum + `FACET_ONTOLOGY` constant. Pins *ontologies,
    not IDs*: EFO (assay; fallbacks OBI then PSI-MS), UBERON, MONDO, NCBITaxon,
    ChEBI, EDAM. `FacetBinding.ontologies()` gives primary→fallback order.
  - `ols.py` — `OlsClient` for OLS4 REST: `search` (free text → class hits) and
    `ancestors` (hierarchical/`is-a`). `http` getter is injectable (offline
    tests); requests wrapped in `sources._retry.with_retries`. `obo_id_to_iri`
    builds EFO + generic OBO-PURL IRIs and the path is double-URL-encoded.
  - `cache.py` — `ResolutionCache`, JSON-on-disk, atomic writes, lock-guarded.
    **Caches negative results** (a *miss* vs a cached-`None` are distinguished via
    `get`'s first return value) so unresolvable strings aren't re-queried.
  - `layers.py` — `derive_molecular_layer(ancestor_labels)`: pure function
    matching EFO ancestor **labels** (not IDs) against a pinned anchor set;
    most-specific-first; no-anchor default `MolecularLayer.UNKNOWN`.
  - `resolver.py` — `OntologyResolver`: `resolve_term(text, facet)` (cache → OLS
    exact-then-fuzzy across the facet's ontologies → optional LLM fallback) and
    `molecular_layer(assay_id, assay_label=None)`. All collaborators injectable;
    default cache is lazy so construction touches neither disk nor network.
  - `base.py` — `ResolvedTerm` value type + the narrow `TermResolver` Protocol
    normalizers depend on.
- **`MolecularLayer` StrEnum added to `models/graph_schema.py`** (its home, since
  `models` depends on nothing and it becomes a node field in PR 4b). Not yet a
  stored field anywhere.
- **Normalizer wired:** `CellxgeneNormalizer(resolver=...)` now grounds the bare
  organism string to NCBITaxon via the resolver (replacing `_ORGANISM_ONTOLOGY`).
  Tissue/disease/assay still use the IDs Census already ships — only organism was
  free text. An organism that fails to resolve is **skipped** (no ungrounded node
  emitted), logged at WARNING.
- **Decisions / rationale:**
  - **OLS4-only** (open question §7 resolved): text2term/Zooma deferred to GEO
    (PR 5), where the messy `characteristics_ch1` strings actually appear.
  - **LLM fallback is a pluggable `Callable`, default `None`** — keeps `ontology`
    free of any `parce.agent`/Azure import (dependency direction preserved); PR 5
    wires the extraction agent in as the callback.
  - **Anchor set is keyed by EFO label, not term ID** (honours "pin
    ontologies/anchors, not IDs"). **PROVISIONAL** — unvalidated against live EFO;
    `tests/test_ontology_integration.py` (marked, live OLS) is the validation
    harness. PR 4b must run it and correct labels, else assays derive `UNKNOWN`.
  - **`ontology` reuses `sources._retry`** (leaf util, no cycle) per CLAUDE.md.
  - Resolver config (OLS base URL, cache dir) is constructor params, **not**
    `Settings` — avoids the unit-test `Settings()` hermeticity trap; could move to
    Settings later.
- **Tests:** offline unit suites for registry / cache / OLS (fake HTTP getter) /
  layers / resolver (fake client + real cache on tmp_path); `test_normalize.py`
  and `test_orchestration.py` inject a fake resolver so they stay offline. New
  marked integration test for live OLS (organism exact; molecular_layer plumbing).
- **mypy:** no new exemptions; `parce.agent.*` exemption stays (PR 5). 24 source
  files checked, clean.
- **Gates green, incl. hermetic run (worktree has no `.env`):** ruff check,
  ruff format --check (40 files), mypy, **121 unit tests** (was 47+retry). No dep
  changes (stdlib + `requests`), so no `uv.lock` change.
- **Next session:** PR 4b (schema refinement) — and validate the provisional
  `molecular_layer` anchors against live EFO first.

### 2026-06-24 — Generic retry helper (resilience follow-up to PR 3)

- Branch `add-generic-retry-helper`. Not a roadmap PR; **closes the retry
  follow-up flagged in the PR 3 entry below.** Next up stays PR 4. (Authored
  before PR 3 merged, then merged on top of it — adapters now live in `sources/`.)
- Problem: PR 3 removed the Azure-keyed `_is_transient`/`_backoff_delay` helpers
  from `main.py` along with the LLM call (their only caller), leaving the
  CELLxGENE/EuropePMC network IO with no retry/backoff.
- Added `src/parce/sources/_retry.py`: generic, dependency-neutral
  `with_retries(func, ...)` + `is_transient(exc)` (exponential backoff, full
  jitter); mypy-checked stable core, reusable by GEO (PR 5) / PRIDE (PR 7).
- Transient = stdlib `TimeoutError`/`ConnectionError`/`OSError`, `requests`
  connection/timeout errors, and `requests` HTTPError with 429/5xx. **Gotcha
  recorded:** every `requests` exception subclasses `OSError`, so requests
  errors are classified *first* — otherwise a 404 / malformed-URL would be
  wrongly retried.
- Wired into `sources/cellxgene.py` (`open_soma`, datasets table read,
  `get_obs`, `get_source_h5ad_uri`) and `sources/publication.py`
  (`fetch_paper_metadata` — `requests.get` + `raise_for_status` wrapped together
  so 429/5xx actually retry).
- Tests: `tests/test_retry.py` (classification + retry/exhaustion, sleep
  patched) and `tests/test_ncbi_fetcher.py` (offline 503 / conn-error → success
  wiring). Updated CLAUDE.md resilience reference to point at `sources/_retry.py`.
- Gates green incl. hermetic no-`.env` run: ruff, ruff format, mypy, unit tests.

### 2026-06-24 — PR 3: Source-adapter interface + CELLxGENE adapter

- Branch `pr3-source-adapter-interface` off `main` (69d1f68).
- **New contracts.** `models/raw_record.py` adds `RawRecord` (source-shaped:
  `source`, `study_id`, `title`, free-form `payload`) — the boundary object
  between adapters and normalizers. `sources/base.py` defines the `SourceAdapter`
  Protocol (`source_name`, `discover(query) -> [ref]`, `fetch(ref) -> RawRecord`);
  `normalize/base.py` defines the `Normalizer` Protocol
  (`normalize(record) -> KnowledgeGraphOutput`). Both `@runtime_checkable`.
- **CELLxGENE migrated to a deterministic adapter + normalizer:**
  - `tools/cellxgene_fetcher.py` → `sources/cellxgene.py` (`CellxgeneAdapter` +
    the `fetch_cellxgene_datasets` core fn). **Cell-type extraction dropped**: the
    `cell_type*` Census columns and the `cell_types` summary key are gone (reading
    a data-inferred annotation is leakage even before it hits the graph).
  - `tools/ncbi_fetcher.py` → `sources/publication.py` (`fetch_paper_metadata`,
    EuropePMC). The adapter's `fetch` gathers the publication title here because
    Census exposes dataset titles + DOI but not the publication title.
  - `graph/builder.py` → `normalize/cellxgene.py` (`CellxgeneNormalizer`). It now
    reads `record.source`/`title`/`payload` instead of taking a hardcoded source.
  - The `@tool`-decorated wrappers (`fetch_cellxgene_data`, `fetch_paper_context`,
    `fetch_geo_metadata`) were vestigial from the agent-tool-calling era and are
    deleted. The whole `tools/` package and the GEO stub are removed.
- **Narrative/LLM path removed entirely:** deleted `agent/curator.py`,
  `agent/prompts.py`, `models/narrative.py` (and `test_models.py`), and the
  `NarrativeOutput` schema. `main.py` is now deterministic and **synchronous**:
  `discover → fetch → normalize → write`. (PR 5 reintroduces async + the agent.)
- Decisions (rationale):
  - **Per-study assembly is the Normalizer's job; `graph/` is reserved for the
    PR 6 cross-source merger.** Matches ARCHITECTURE §3's split. `graph/__init__.py`
    and `agent/__init__.py` are kept as documented placeholders.
  - **Organism→NCBITaxon map (`_ORGANISM_ONTOLOGY`) lives in the normalizer, not
    the adapter.** The adapter emits the raw organism string; string→ID mapping is
    normalization and becomes the PR 4 OntologyResolver's job.
  - **`discover` is the identity on a DOI for CELLxGENE** (a collection = a DOI).
    Keyword collection search is backlog.
  - **Azure-coupled retry helpers removed from `main.py`** with the LLM call (their
    only caller). CELLxGENE/EuropePMC fetches currently have no retry wrapper —
    see follow-up below. CLAUDE.md still references "helpers in `main.py`"; left as
    is since PR 5 reintroduces retry infra for the agent.
- **mypy:** removed the `parce.tools.*` exemption (modules migrated + now fully
  type-checked); `parce.agent.*` exemption stays for PR 5. mypy checks 16 files.
- **Gates green locally, incl. hermetic run with `.env` moved aside:** ruff check,
  ruff format --check (24 files), mypy, **47 unit tests**. No dep changes; the
  `agent-framework`/`azure-*` deps stay (PR 5 needs them).
- **Follow-up for a later session:** wire bounded-retry/backoff into the source
  adapters' network calls (Census, EuropePMC) — resilience regressed when the
  Azure-only retry helpers were removed.
- **Next session:** PR 4 (ontology resolver). First integration point: replace
  `_ORGANISM_ONTOLOGY` in `normalize/cellxgene.py`.

### 2026-06-23 — PR 2: Canonical KG schema

- Branch `pr2-canonical-kg-schema` off `main`.
- Rewrote `models/graph_schema.py` to the source-agnostic canonical schema:
  - `PublicationNode` → **`StudyNode`** (`study_id`, `title`, `source`,
    `modality`); dropped `abstract` and `experimental_narrative`. Raw free text
    belongs to the future `RawRecord`, not the canonical node.
  - `DatasetNode`: `uri`→`data_uri`, `modality`→`assay`; no parent-study field.
  - **`SampleNode`** added (design covariates only: `condition`, `perturbation`,
    `timepoint`, `subject`, `organism`, `data_uri`; all optional). Not populated
    by the CELLxGENE path yet (Census is dataset-level — see ARCHITECTURE §6).
  - `EntityType`: **`CellType` removed** (data-inferred → leakage).
  - `KnowledgeGraphOutput.publications` → `studies`; added `samples`.
- Migrated `graph/builder.py`: signature is now
  `build_knowledge_graph(paper_data, cellxgene_data)` (no `narrative`); emits
  `StudyNode`/`DatasetNode`; ignores input `cell_types`; tissue→`HAS_TISSUE`,
  disease→`HAS_CONDITION`, assay→`MEASURED_WITH`, study→species `STUDIES`.
  `source="CELLxGENE"`, study `modality="scRNA-seq"` (constants for this path).
- Decision: **containment is edge-only.** `DatasetNode` does not store its parent
  `study_id`; the `EXTRACTED_FROM` edge is the single source of truth (avoids a
  denormalized FK that can drift). Recorded in ARCHITECTURE §4.
- `main.py`: step 3 drops the `narrative` arg; summary prints `Studies`/`Samples`.
  **Deferred to PR 3 (not done here):** step 2 still generates the narrative via
  Azure, but its output is now discarded (a comment marks this). `NarrativeOutput`
  stays in `graph_schema.py` and `_build_narrative_prompt` still references
  `cell_types` — both are part of the narrative path PR 3 deletes wholesale.
- Updated tests: `test_graph_schema.py`, `test_builder.py`, `test_orchestration.py`
  (asserts `studies`/`study_id`, no narrative, cell-type exclusion, sample
  covariates, tissue dedup). `models/narrative.py` + `test_models.py` untouched
  (legacy GEO agent schema; PR 3/PR 5 territory).
- Gates green locally (incl. hermetic run with no `.env`): ruff check, ruff
  format --check, mypy (16 files), **52 unit tests** pass. No dep changes.
- **Next session:** PR 3 (source-adapter interface + rip out the narrative path).

### 2026-06-23 — Ontology grounding (docs)
- Decision: every experiment facet binds to one designated ontology (EFO assay,
  UBERON tissue, MONDO disease, NCBITaxon organism, ChEBI/gene-ID perturbation,
  PSI-MS for MS proteomics, EDAM data format). Registry will live in
  `parce/ontology/`.
- Decision: **no free-text `modality` long-term.** Store `assay` (EFO term ID) +
  a coarse `molecular_layer` enum derived by walking EFO `is-a` ancestors — both
  controlled. PR 2 shipped with a `modality` field; this refinement now lands in
  **PR 4** (see ARCHITECTURE §4–5).
- Decision: resolve term IDs at runtime via OLS4 (+ text2term/Zooma, LLM
  fallback); never hardcode IDs. Follow SDRF/MAGE-TAB conventions for the record.
- Added ARCHITECTURE §5 (Ontology grounding; later sections renumbered) and
  sharpened ROADMAP PR 4 (registry + lineage derivation + anchor-set open
  question). Docs only, no code change.
- Authored on the foundations branch and merged on top of PR 2 / PR 3.
  **Next up: PR 3.**

### 2026-06-23 — PR 1: Foundations & tooling
- Branch `restructure-context-metadata` off `main` (post-cxg-merge).
- Decision: the LLM is repurposed from **narrative writing** to **structured
  extraction from unstructured metadata**; Azure is kept to serve that (and as a
  learning goal). Deterministic-by-default everywhere else.
- Decision: multi-modality is core. Source gradient chosen: CELLxGENE (anchor,
  no LLM) → GEO (first extraction target) → PRIDE (cross-modality proof).
- Decision: context = design variables only; **cell type excluded** (data-
  inferred → leakage). Sample-level covariates to be reintroduced into the KG.
- Added: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Tooling: ruff rule set (E,F,I,UP,B,SIM,C4,RUF) + `ruff format`; mypy with
  pydantic plugin, `src/parce` checked, `parce.tools.*`/`parce.agent.*`
  temporarily exempt (remove on migration). Formatted all files.
- Gates green locally: ruff check, ruff format --check, mypy, 43 unit tests.
- **Next session:** PR 2 (canonical KG schema). No code behavior changed yet;
  `main.py` still runs the old narrative pipeline until PR 3.
